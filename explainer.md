Potential Solutions for Ticketing System Challenges

it seems the current ticketing system struggles with recurring low-priority alerts and inefficient prioritization. Here's how the below mention products can potentially address these issues:

1. PagerDuty (https://www.pagerduty.com/)

Strengths:
    Incident Management: PagerDuty excels at managing incidents, which are critical events requiring immediate attention. It can:
    - Aggregate alerts from various sources (including your ticketing system).
    - De-duplicate recurring alerts, eliminating alert fatigue for engineers.
    - Route alerts to the appropriate on-call engineers based on pre-defined rules (like zone or issue type). This ensures critical issues get addressed swiftly.
    - Alert Prioritization: PagerDuty allows customization of alert rules to prioritize incidents based on severity, impact, or zone. This helps engineers focus on the most critical issues first.

Considerations:
 - Cost: PagerDuty has a freemium model with limited features. Advanced features for prioritization and de-duplication might require a paid subscription.

2. Grafana Cloud IRM (https://grafana.com/products/cloud/irm/)

Strengths:
 - Alerting & Prioritization: Grafana Cloud IRM offers alerting functionalities with prioritization options. You can set conditions to prioritize alerts based on specific metrics or thresholds.
 - Visualization: Grafana excels at data visualization. If your ticketing system data integrates with Grafana, you can create dashboards to visualize historical trends and identify recurring low-priority alerts. This can help identify root causes for these alerts and potentially eliminate them.

Considerations:
 - Focus: Grafana Cloud IRM might be a broader incident response platform compared to PagerDuty's dedicated alerting focus. Evaluate if the additional features are valuable for your needs.
